In order to make changes and test them you might want to create a "develop" container. To do this you can use commands available in the Makefile:

*These are commands done on the development machine. If you are developing locally feel free to use the commands but don't push to DockerHub

## Bulding develop container
```bash
make build
```

## Running Bash inside container
```bash
make bash
```
